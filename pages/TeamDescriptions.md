Organizing events can be a painful and time-consuming process. From the endless number of emails with suppliers and sponsors, to answering participants and volunteer enquiries, organizing events is hard, especially for bigger events.

Current solutions like online registration and event management software have helped make the lives of event organizers a little easier by handling common activities such as registrations, payments, or attendance taking. However, these softwares do not allow effective coordination between the event organizers and other key stakeholders that plays an important role in ensuring event success.

This is why 8packs has built a collaborative event management platform where events are not organized by the event organizers alone, but by everyone involved in the event. This includes participants, volunteers, sponsors, suppliers, and fans.

8packs is a collaborative event management platform for running, cycling, swimming, and other events with one or more combination of the three. Unlike other software companies like EventBrite, Active RegOnline and Cvent, 8packs is not just building better software and systems for the event organizers. 8packs is building 3rd generation event technology that can harnesses the strength of the community and allow for collaboration between key stakeholders of the event.
###Aperture Medical
End-stage renal disease (ESRD) affects more than 2 million men, women, and children worldwide. For these patients, renal-replacement therapy is a life-sustaining treatment and reliable access to the bloodstream for hemodialysis is their lifeline. Arteriovenous fistulas and grafts – surgically created connections between arteries and veins in the extremities – constitute the most prevalent and best options for hemodialysis access. However, due to scarring and narrowing of the blood vessels, these connections frequently fail within months and only 50-60% of connections last a full year. This translates to further invasive procedures, hospitalizations, and riskier modes of dialysis access for patients and a substantial economic burden to the healthcare system.
Aperture Medical aims to address this problem by targeting the most upstream biological event in the development blood vessel narrowing or stenosis. By targeting the root cause of stenosis, we aim to significantly improve the short and long-term patency of arteriovenous fistulas and grafts for patients with ESRD. Our solution is a one-time intervention at the time of creation that integrates easily into existing surgical procedures and leverages new scientific insights into vascular biology. With this novel approach Aperture Medical aims to bring innovation to this truly unmet clinical need.
###Apprentice Field Suite
Pharmaceutical and Biotechnology Manufacturing, with its strict regulations, creates unique demands for deskless workers. The million dollar losses if a batch fails, the inability to out-engineer human error, and the potential of the technology inspired us to develop the Apprentice Field Suite - a trio of applications exclusively for Smart Glasses that empowers Biopharmaceutical Manufacturing operators and engineers to make informed decisions. GAUGE provides essential data. Computer vision automatically reads and saves analog gauge values, augmented reality shows which bioreactor is still in operation before you attempt to clean the vessel, and photo/video allows self-reporting of unsafe conditions. MANUALS is a process and workflow aid. The app integrates with Myo for hands-free access to the latest Standard Operating Procedures, Batch Record, or Job Plans. Each workflow can be fully animated step-by-step AR overlay, or simply a list of text-based procedures. TANDEM provides a sophisticated troubleshooting interface. A remote engineer becomes a telepresence, able to pinpoint process issues for on-the-floor operators by ‘seeing what operators see’, and drawing on their field of vision in real-time. Engineers can also use the app to bring graphs, historical process data and P&ID’s into the manufacturing suite for troubleshooting.
###aProlix
aProlix is a customer service platform that aims to improve the smartphone experience between customers and businesses. The problem is two-fold:
1) businesses struggle in managing their call centers to provide great and cost-effective customer service, forcing them to put obstacles in the way of their callers;
2) callers get frustrated when waiting on hold or listening through long recorded audio menus, leading to poor company reputation and lowered sales and loyalty. 

Their product is two-fold - it provides:
1) smartphone callers with a seamlessly accessible web menu to schedule callbacks for assistance
2) businesses with a web dashboard to better serve their customers' requests.

As long as a caller has a smartphone with web access, they are redirected from a phone call to a link within an SMS that allows them to see a web menu in order to submit a request to either receive a callback or to be texted back. We currently have three clients on board that provide us with user experience data, which we use to iterate on new features. This solution is unique because it organically hooks smartphone callers into a business' customer service funnel and allows for 1-1 and 1-many communications via SMS.
###Assured
Buying insurance for mobile devices (phones and tablets) disadvantages cautious and responsible users due to the absence of price discrimination. The standard practice for protection plan providers is to charge everyone the same price for coverage regardless of the user’s device history, demographics or usage behavior. This one-price-for-all-users (approx.. 10 USD/month) strategy means careful and responsible consumers pay a significant premium to their actuarially fair trade of risk while careless users enjoy a discount. In other words, the cautious subsidize the costs for the careless. Assured believed careful and responsible people deserve a fair trade on risk (which can be as low as 2 USD/month) and should not have to subsidize the cost for the careless. Assured uses data from device sensors and predictive analytics to assess an individual’s risk and provide insights to lower their risk of loss and damage. Assured offers fairly priced and transparent insurance via the mobile app for low-risk users of smartphones.
###Audacy
Audacy solves the communication problem for the commercial space industry. Currently, each space company builds its own ground stations to communicate with its spacecraft. However geography and politics mean that no matter how many ground stations are built, 30% earth coverage is the maximum achievable limit. Communications are currently the bottleneck of the commercial space industry. Apart from their expense, ground stations cannot handle anywhere near the data rate generated by modern spacecraft, which for earth-imaging satellites can be terabytes of data every day. Timeliness of data is critical for many companies, so the >70% blackout time represents a significant loss of revenue. Audacy’s constellation of relay satellites provides 100% continuous coverage of all earth-moon space to client spacecraft. It uses the latest wireless multi-access technology to serve high data rates to hundreds of simultaneous users, negating ground stations and removing barriers of entry to the space industry. Companies simply buy a Verizon-style data subscription plan, install an Audacy-approved radio on their spacecraft, and their communications are sorted. There is no doubt that this great consumer need for continuous spacecraft communication will eventually be satisfied, it is simply a question of when and by whom.
###Bandura Games
Bandura Games addresses two problems. The first is that multi-player cooperative video games (where players play on the same team and must cooperate in order to succeed) are extremely popular for PlayStation and XBOX consoles, but have not yet become popular for mobile devices like Apple and Android phones. There are about 2,000 cooperative games for console, and only 200 for mobile. People have a demand for cooperative games, but the market has not responded to design them for mobile devices. Bandura Games takes games that are already popular for mobile devices and redesigns them to be multiplayer and cooperative in order to address that demand. 

The social problem they address is that people across conflict zones rarely interact, which perpetuates conflict. They intend to use our cooperative mobile games as a medium for creating empathy and connections across conflict zones. 
###Beacon
If one were to ask the first ten people they met in most U.S. cities what they would do if someone were hit by a car in front of them, most everyone would say, “Call 911.” Ask the same question anywhere in the developing world and they won’t say "911", but they will give you an answer, and if you ask enough people you’ll see patterns in their responses that are describing informal emergency response systems - they're uncoordinated, unreliable, and inefficient, but very robust. Because Western-style ambulance services simply can’t be sustained without lots of money and good roads, Beacon's approach is to strengthen existing systems by leveraging available resources – namely, underemployed young adults with access to transport and phones in their pockets. With nearly 4.5 billion people in the developing world carrying a cellphone, there’s no reason they shouldn’t have a way to call for help, too.
###BioCarbon Engineering
BioCarbon Engineering was founded to plant at least 1 Billion trees (~570,000 Hectares) per year. Net annual destruction of global forests and jungles from over production of lumber, strip surface mining, and increased land usage results in 5 million hectares of forests (~11b trees), disappearing each year. Destruction of these critical ecosystems occurs at a faster rate than reforestation because current planting techniques (e.g. hand planting) cannot match the rate of industrial scale deforestation. Our scalable solution leverages off emerging remote sensing and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) technologies to enable automated, industrial scale reforestation. The system works in three stages to significantly increase the planting rate (10x) while simultaneously driving down the cost (15% of current planting costs). We will use satellite data sets to evaluate the current ecosystem with 3-5m resolution maps, and we will use UAV sensors to make detailed 5-centimeter resolution maps including topology, ecosystem health, biodiversity, soil types, moisture and nutrients. This data generates an optimized planting pattern map (similar to precision agriculture techniques), matching species to location, and is driven by ecosystem and biodiversity restoration requirements. Finally, we will use UAV-based reforestation combined with the optimized planting pattern to physically plant a tree at each location.
###Bounty Box
More than 6 billion pounds of fresh produce go unharvested or unsold every year in the U.S. A material portion of that produce is wasted simply because it's the wrong size, shape or color. In other words, it isn't pretty or uniform enough for the grocery store shelf. (Think crooked carrots or small apples.) That loss impacts farmers (lower profit) and the environment (waste of water & energy, increased methane). Meanwhile, consumer demand for responsibly grown produce is increasing, as is their desire for convenience and their desire for making a difference through their purchases. Currently, farmers don't have a reliable channel through which to sell the "off-spec" produce, and customers don't have a way to buy it. Bounty Box aims to monetize for farmers the off-spec produce that they can't sell through existing retail channels, aggregate the produce across farms, and then sell that perfectly fresh produce to consumers at a discount to retail. Consumers pay less, farmers get paid more, and collectively we reduce food waste. They have been mostly focused on direct-to-consumer sales through produce boxes (125+ boxes sold in only three prototypes), but have had a few enterprise sales as well.
###Cerulean Robotics
Video recording devices are now ubiquitous. As smartphones, GoPros, and DSLRs record our lives in high definition, we can get so caught up in capturing a moment that we often forget to enjoy the moment while it’s happening. More often than not, our videos don’t come out as we intend. Subjects are out of frame or the footage is not good quality, making even a mountain biking adventure for example turn out to be unwatchable. In our selfie generation, if we want to be in our own videos we have to have another person shooting the footage. Even professional camera operators have trouble tracking moving subjects while they themselves are moving.

Camtron is an intelligent and personal robotic cameraman. Camtron stabilizes your camera about 3 axes and intelligently tracks subjects using our advanced computer vision and machine learning algorithms without the use of a beacon. Simply identify a subject using our app, and our system will stay locked-on, even if it is in motion or the subject is obstructed momentarily. Camtron produces effortlessly smooth footage of your experience and leaves you free to enjoy without the hassle or worry that comes with other products.
###CookNook
CookNook is a new FoodTech concept within the restaurant replacement space that connects domestic cooks with eaters through a marketplace and meal delivery system. Domestic cooks will operate mini-restaurants from the comfort of their own homes that will supply meals to eaters through quick and efficient logistics. Similar to how a consumer can order food delivery on GrubHub or DoorDash, consumers will be able to see meals that are being cooked by “qualified chefs” within some geographic proximity. Meals can be ordered in advance or on an ad-hoc basis and will be delivered at a predetermined time.

CookNook’s value proposition to cooks comes from empowering cooks to be microentrepreneurs that can sell meals through a marketplace of eaters. The value proposition for eaters comes from (i) lower-cost meals (through limited overhead and potential access to wholesale produce) (ii) faster delivery time (through cooking a very limited menu of entrees) and (iii) the nostalgia of eating a home-cooked meal. CookNook will seek to replicate the sharing economy value proposition that Airbnb and Uber are able to generate from underutilized spare rooms and cars, respectively, by extracting more value from domestic kitchen and skilled cooking labor.
###Create Cusine
Next to smoking, obesity is the second leading cause of preventable death in the United States. One in three children in the United States are overweight or obese. More notably, due to the rising obesity epidemic, this is the first time in history that American children are expected to live shorter lives than their parents.

Obese children are more prone to miss school and have lower self-esteem, leading to decreased academic performance. Additionally, childhood obesity increases the risk of chronic disease, including heart disease, which is the top cause of death in the United States. While there are a number of other organizations working in the area, none specifically focus on getting children to enjoy eating produce.

It is from these insights that Create Cuisine chose to focus on enhancing the produce eating experience for children by encouraging what kids already love to do-play with their food. Create Cuisine encourages kids to literally play with their food, building carrot stick towers with delicious hummus dip (Green Machine, Razzy Red, Spicy Sriracha, and Perfect Plain). Although this is their current prototype, they plan to expand Create Cuisine to include multiple assembly based produce snacks.
###Eden
Eden is solving the powerful consumer frustration related to technology installation and maintenance at the home. It is a hassle to install consumer electronics (e.g., TV mounting) and frustrating to repair and maintain it when it malfunctions (e.g., computer viruses). Further, there are currently no customer-oriented, on demand providers of tech support to turn to, as Geek Squad has a 1.5 star rating on Yelp! due to terrible customer service (despite having $2+ billion in sales). 

As such, the founders built Eden, which provides on demand tech support for consumers. They have a platform of vetted, 5-star tech contractors who come right to the consumer, whenever they are needed. They are offering the traditional Geek Squad services using an Uber contractor model, and also have newer services related to home automation / internet of things. They are post-pilot / post-revenue and recently raised $100K+ of venture funding from a leading venture capital firm in Silicon Valley.
###EVIMED - Central Venous Catheter Connector
Over 15% of patients undergoing central venous catheterization (CVC) have complications, including mechanical, infectious and thrombotic events. Nearly 5-15% of patients with CVC experience central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI). It is the most common nosocomial (in-hospital) infection and results in prolonged length of stay (from 5-20 days), significant morbidity and an increase in crude mortality (from 12-25%). CVC infections remain common in the U.S., with over 80,000 CLABSIs each year. Most efforts to reduce CLABSI involve behavior modifications to mitigate patient risk during CVC insertion and maintenance - these behavior modifications fall short of solving the problem. A thoughtless solution is needed to eliminate this serious infection, save lives, and reduce wasteful spending. 

EVIMED has developed a port protector device that attaches to a needleless connector on a catheter hub. This port protector provides effortless sterilization releasing a combination of alcohol and chlorohexidine upon connection.The EVIMED eliminates the need for behavioral modification. Initial testing demonstrates the product will lower infections by over 50%! We have filed for a provisional patent, and the Stanford Vascular access team is excited to run a trial this Summer.
###FirstResponse Disaster Solutions
FirstResponse Disaster Solutions focuses on saving lives and money by fundamentally changing post-disaster response prioritization and resource management.

They address disaster issues such as:
1)First day is lost to chaos after a large emergency -- initial assessments take days
2)No unifying information technology platform for disaster response
3)Response priorities based only on ad-hoc decisions from 911 calls -- delayed rescue

Their solution is a cloud-based immediate damage predictions and response recommendations after a disaster customized to each region

FirstResponse Disaster Solution's features include:
1) Damage predictions available in minutes via a visual color-coded map application
2) Collates data sources across various emergency support functions that enriches with live reports. (This is an additional feature we have obtained via customer reports)
3) Provides information about critical infrastructure (as dictated by each jurisdiction) & safe routes 
4) Recommends response priorities by accounting for priority level, population density, and damage
###FlossTime
According to statistics, more than half of the US population (>150 million) do not floss on a daily basis while a third of all Americans do not floss at all. As flossing does the work required to remove plaque from your teeth, the lack of flossing leads to periodontal diseases and bad breath. Clinical studies further indicate that poor oral hygiene has been linked to many chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease and cancer. Flossing, as with anything else, is a HABIT that needs to be cultivated. Most products focus on simply making flossing easier or improving the quality of the floss, both of which do not help consumers build daily flossing habits. The solution is FlossTime, the world's first of a kind, smart-learning, automated floss reminder and dispenser device. FlossTime mounts to your bathroom mirror and then programs itself to remind you for how long and when to floss. FlossTime dispenses and cuts your floss, and provides colorful LED light cues for flossing time and duration. Compared to current flossing methods, FlossTime is the only product designed with habit-forming mechanisms in mind, and will help to improve flossing compliance and general dental health in adults and children.
###FoodMatix
There are three main problems associated with university food waste:
1) students are not satisfied with the quality of food, which leads to plate waste
2) dining halls cannot anticipate accurate number of students and how much food to produce on a daily basis
3) no accessible platform to improve communication between dining halls and students.

FoodMatix's strategy is to reduce food waste by improving information exchange between students and dining management that takes into account the incentives of both parties. They intend to build an app that will serve as a platform for information exchange. The app allows dining halls to provide information including menu, caloric intake, incentivized RSVP options, and feedback. A detailed menu allows students to optimize satisfactory food consumption, which leads to less food waste. Incentivized RSVP, e.g., in the form of bonus meals, improves prediction of student attendance. Lastly, feedback, in the form of reviews and comments, allows dining halls to better understand and satisfy student food preferences.
###Footsteps
Problem: Patients are aware that physical therapy (PT) is necessary for recovery, but even the most athletically-minded, motivated people sometimes lose motivation to do assigned at-home exercises because it's time-consuming, boring, and performed solo. Patients forget to do their exercises because they lack tools to integrate PT into their daily routine and are sometimes unsure what they're supposed to do. When patients don't do PT, they take longer to recover and may get re-injured. Solution: Footsteps is a mobile app and web platform aimed to improve the at-home PT experience. Footsteps empower patients with supports tools based on published research, over 120 interviews with patients and therapists, beta-tester feedback, and consultation with experts from Stanford’s Persuasive Technology Lab. Footsteps includes habit-forming features so that patients keep coming back each day. This includes a customized exercise plan, meaningful goal-setting, thoughtful reminders, gamified progress, the ability to virtually include family and friends for moral support, and access to phone consultations with Footsteps' PT experts on staff. Footsteps believes that by first targeting athletically-minded patients (deemed "weekend warriors"), Footsteps can gain early traction and later target insurers to make Footsteps available more broadly.
###Genesis Technologies
Genesis Technologies is developing a next-generation platform for gene synthesis, the process of turning digital computer text into physical DNA sequences. Current methods of gene synthesis are slow and expensive, and rely on dated technology from the 1970s. These methods consume expensive and cost-limiting chemical building blocks (oligonucleotides) during the synthesis process, resulting in high prices to customers. Additionally, these methods cannot handle sequence complexities such as repetitions, which forces customers to redesign their sequences to accommodate the service provider. Finally, turnaround time is very poor, with customers usually waiting 20 days or more for their sequences to be synthesized and delivered. The result is a high-cost, low-quality product that impedes research progress into game-changing applications like microbe-derived biofuels and anti-cancer biotherapeutics. Our solution is next-generation technology that will reuse the raw materials that current technologies consume, and use catalytic reactions on an all solid-phase, chip-based platform. This method will synthesize and ship DNA an order of magnitude more cheaply and more quickly than all competing services. Our technology will allow us to service the $850M and growing market for DNA synthesis more efficiently and affordably than our competitors. Our vision is to become the leading provider for synthesized DNA.
###Give A Day Global
Give a Day Global addresses two problems:
1) Nonprofit organizations in developing countries need sustainable revenue streams and more supporters in order to serve their communities.
2) International travellers want unique, authentic, and meaningful experiences that can fit into their itineraries.

Their solution is a web and mobile platform that lists one day volunteering opportunities at nonprofit organizations in developing countries. 

They make it convenient for travelers to do good while having fun, in addition to providing nonprofits with an ongoing revenue stream, new supporters, and increased visibility. 

Travelers can browse and book online, which fits in with travel industry trends for booking travel tours and activities on web and mobile platforms.

They currently have 15 vetted nonprofit organizations listed on our platform in Asia, Africa, and Latin America all located near large hub cities or tourist destinations. They have had 43 users volunteer for a day, all with raving reviews. They are working on expanding our pilot to learn more about both sides of our platform we may begin to scale.
###Healthy Horizons Lactation Services
There is a lack of support for women who are lactating/breastfeeding in the workforce. Companies with 50+ employees are required by federal and state law to provide breastfeeding facilities. This also affects female employee retention, morale, job satisfaction, and work life balance. There is a lack of education and training for managers around these mandates and lactation accommodations which effects support of these programs. The solution is Healthy Horizons Lactation Services. We offer a comprehensive approach to workplace lactation support that is more than just a pump and a room. It entails a detailed analysis of demographics related to the number of woman and new parents who will need such services. We then provide lactation accommodation policy (which is mandated) review, draft and revisions individualized to each company and along with management training on an ongoing basis. We support the company’s ability to provide proper and comprehensive support by offering the following services. Lactation space design and consultation, pump and products procurement, pump and lactation room monitoring, servicing of equipment. Prenatal and postnatal education and support services such as classes and one on one lactation support via in person, phone, video conferencing, texting and e-mail by certified lactation consultants.
###JetInsight
Private aircraft charter operators lack the technology necessary to collect data and optimize their businesses. Most operators still use legacy technology from the 1990s that lacks salesforce automation, revenue management, and customer relatonshp management (CRM) capabilities that are standard in most comparable industries. Generic products such as Salesforce are not suitable for the industry due to its complex quoting, perishable and fixed inventory, and required integration with operational systems. We are building a sales and CRM platform specifically for the private aviation charter industry. We streamline the workflow for operators from the initial quote request through to invoicing (including automated quoting, salesforce automation, electronic contracting, online payment, and CRM capabilities). More importantly, we provide actionable insights from the data that operators generate through the platform to help operators increase their conversion, optimize pricing, and reduce repositioning flights (empty legs). Simply put, we convert operators from intuition-driven sales to data-driven sales.
###Kibbit
Soft skills are critical to career success, but people don't train them and miss out on opportunities because of it (e.g., blowing a job interview, or not negotiating salary). Kibbit finds people practice partners through a special matching algorithm, then gives them a curated experience to learn, practice via video chat, record feedback, and track progress, including benchmarking performance against others.

Practicing soft skills can seem intimidating, but Kibbit makes it fun through great UX/UI and building on small modular experiences which celebrate progress using gamification and social tools. The way Duolingo made language learning fun, Kibbit makes job interview prep, and other interpersonal skills training fun.
###Legacy Partners
Legacy Partners is a tech-enabled service that improves quality and reduces cost in end-of-life care. Currently, incentives, constraints, and mindsets create a healthcare system in which 1) terminally-ill patients do not engage in end-of-life planning; 2) patients and their families lack information and agency when it comes to their end-of-life care; and 3) providers often pursue treatment beyond what is consistent with patients’ values and quality of life. As a result, end-of-life care fails to meet patient needs, leaves undue burden on families and caregivers, and incurs inordinate costs. Medicare alone spends $170B (28% of its annual budget) on the last 6 months of care, yet less than one third of families who want to engage in end-of-life planning actually do so. Legacy Partners couples parahealth professionals with a patient-centric technology platform to engage, educate, and empower families to understand options, prioritize values, and enable behavior change. Building on trusted relationships and elegant tools, we disrupt the revolving door of healthcare and drive ROI by reducing unwanted care while dramatically improving patient satisfaction.
###Mesopharm Therapeutics Inc.
Mesopharm seeks to address the problem of aggressive cancers for which current treatments provide suboptimal therapeutic effects. Aggressive cancers are those, which are diagnosed at an advanced (metastatic) stage or have progressed/recurred following previous therapies. Inherently, patients with these aggressive cancers display minimal survival rates, many dying within 12 months. Thus the biopharmaceutical industry (patients, providers, payers, drug companies) is in need of new breakthrough therapeutic modalities.

Two such cancers we are initially targeting are pleural malignant mesothelioma (MLM) and unresectable or metastatic pancreatic cancer (PC). Both populations of patients have minimal survival and limited therapeutic options. The development of targeted and effective therapies has not occurred due to the lack of cancer specific antigens and the ability to deliver sizable therapeutic effects without incurring dose-limiting toxicities.

Our unique solution is a new game-changing drug that utilizes advanced monoclonal antibody design (developed and licensed by the NIH) armed with a radioactive warhead. This candidate is able to deliver a more potent cancer-killing agent in an extremely targeted manner. This allows Mesopharm to create a superior position in the competitive landscape.
###Miti Health
Across East Africa, private-sector health clinics and pharmacies play a critical, frontline role in providing medical care to millions of patients. In Kenya alone, there are more than 6,000 private pharmaceutical outlets that serve as the first and often only point of care for patients and act as a stopgap to the public healthcare system, where drug stockouts occur an estimated 68% of the time. The supply chains that serve these pharmacies, however, are highly fragmented, and it is estimated that 20-45% of medicine sold in Sub-Saharan Africa and South-East Asia is counterfeit or substandard. This results in an estimated 700,000 deaths and $1.6 billion in diverted revenue yearly. These ineffective supply chains, combined with poor information on drug quality and operational inefficiencies, also lead to inflated costs and threaten the quality of care provided to patients. Miti Health addresses these challenges by (1) providing an Android-based smartphone and tablet platform for healthcare providers; (2) certifying high-quality distributors of medication; and (3) building a recognizable brand to strengthen the market power of pharmacists. This integrated system expands patients’ access to affordable, quality healthcare, reduces counterfeit medications sold in East Africa, and provides better information for customers and healthcare providers.
###MYcrogrid
US solar companies only offer solar power systems for large houses with monthly utility bills over $100. According to the EIA, about 50 million households in the US (out of 130 million) have electricity bills lower than $100 and therefore don’t have access to typical solar financing options, such as PPAs and leasing agreements, which make solar power systems affordable.

MYcrogrid is designing a safe, modular, do-it-yourself solar powered microgrid backed up with batteries. Their vision is to make solar energy accessible to everyone by making it affordable and as easy to install as a typical household appliance.

Their product would simplify distribution of solar powered microgrid products by selling the all-inclusive package through online retailers, such as Amazon, and possibly through hardware retailers, such as Home Depot or Lowe’s.
###neoLIFE therapeutics
"Catheter-associated bloodstream infections (CABSI) in neonates with umbilical catheters occur at a rate that is five times higher than CABSI in adults (5-15% vs <1%). Furthermore, the morbidity associated with a CABSI in a neonate is 7-11%, meaning that thousands of infants are dying each year from a potentially preventable problem. LIFEbubble, neoLIFE therapeutics’ first medical device, seeks to reduce CABSIs in neonates with umbilical catheters in order to save the lives of these vulnerable infants. 

Multiple devices exist focused on reduction of CABSIs in adults. These devices have two common mechanisms of action: protection of the area around catheter insertion and stabilization of the catheter. For neonates with umbilical catheters, however, the current standard of care is an elaborate tape design by nurses, which does not protect the umbilical area and offers only variable stabilization of the catheter, leading to an increase in potentially preventable CABSIs. LIFEbubble’s design employs the knowledge gained through adult device predicates as it both protects the umbilical stump, where the catheter is inserted, and stabilizes the catheter. Through this unique, tailored design, LIFEbubble will be able to reduce CABSIs in order to save the lives of these vulnerable infants."
###NexTint
A large portion of building facades is made of glass to provide occupants with a connection to the outside world that can improve mood and productivity while also bringing in natural daylight, but intense sunlight can also cause glare, uncomfortable heating, and increased cooling costs. Blinds, which tend to stay closed, and static tints, which sacrifice daylighting, are not ideal solutions, but they are cost-effective and thus widespread. Electrochromic windows are recognized as an excellent technology that can satisfy variety of requirements placed on windows, but current technologies are too expensive for widespread adoption. 

Using a low-cost material and manufacturing process, NexTint is developing an electrochromic, plastic film that can be applied as a retrofit to existing windows. Leading competitors, Sage, View are selling whole, electrochromic glazing units for up to $150/ft^2. Using patent-pending stability innovations inspired by PhD work of our cofounders, NexTint has developed an electrochromic material that can be roll-to-roll printed on plastic and applied to existing windows for retrofit solutions, resulting in a much lower installed cost for the film of $20-25/ft^2 and access to a much larger market.
###Nom Naturals
As the Wall Street Journal writes, "US consumers continue to eat in cars. People are snacking more instead of cooking meals. They want healthy, exciting food that still tastes good." Nom solves this consumer need through their reinvention of healthy snacks that are less processed, packaged in a cutting edge, on-the-go delivery format, and boosted with functional probiotics.
###ODECI
The first target user for ODECI Inc. will be US Army aviators. The first problem they are solving is that of supplemental task lighting. Current solutions for small personal lights in a cockpit have attempted to address pilot light requirements though finger lights or by strapping a light onto things like flight vests or the front cockpit panel. ODECI Illuminate allows the pilot to switch on, illuminate, and use a light all in one hand. This allows for better cockpit task management, as they will not have to remove both hands from the aircraft controls to receive well-aimed light. All buttons and features of the product have been designed with the military aviator in mind and in compliance with military regulation. Through connections in the Department of Defense we are working on obtaining military contract for the long-term sale of this product.
###PartyPuzzle
Throwing a kids party is a very time consuming and expensive activity. Parents need to spend much time planning and arranging everything separately: finding a venue, finding and selecting animation services, buying food, buying decoration items and party bags etc. Additionally, often parents are not satisfied with the quality of the provided services. There is no platform that brings together and coordinates all of the necessary party services providers. PartyPuzzle is a web-based platform that offers parents a one-stop-shop solution for the organization, payment and delivery of parties for kids from 0 to 11 years. Based on a few characteristics (gender, age, location, date, and budget) the easy-to-use tool will make suggestions for service providers for all of the necessary services and products. Those include venue, theme, decoration items, food items, and animation. After the assembly of the party, PartyPuzzle will coordinate the logistics of the party so that your complete party gets delivered on the required date. In essence, it is a 2-sided market place that connects party organizers with existing and potential party service suppliers. PartyPuzzle is a layer in between that provides simple planning, quality assurance and coordination. 
###Qollaboration
Qollaboration solving a problem that has challenged organizations for decades. There are lots of smart people, with unique skills and expertise, but the knowledge in their heads isn't searchable. There is no quick way to find the right expertise when you need it. So people resort to sending mass emails or knocking on doors to ask colleagues - this wastes a lot of time and rarely yields the best possible guidance. Enter Qollaboration, a search engine for skills and knowledge. Qollaboration let you instantly find and access specific expertise within your company, university or professional association, by identifying and introducing you to the knowledge holder.

###Quorum
In Washington D.C. alone there are over 50,000 people who every day run, staff, and influence the legislative process without modern software. These individuals rely on intuition and guesswork to make strategic decisions, obtaining data from thousands of different websites and manually tabulating votes to find trends. They compare different versions of bills with a highlighter and use Excel to track their outreach. What’s worse, the legislative strategy software these individuals currently use is inadequate, lacking necessary legislative data and providing no way to help users derive quantitative insights. Busy legislative professionals need an easy-to-use, comprehensive, timesaving tool to help craft their legislative strategy, and the current model is not delivering. Quorum is Washington’s next generation legislative strategy platform that solves these problems by providing unique quantitative insights into the U.S. Congress. Featuring interactive visualizations, up-to-date statistics, and comprehensive congressional data including bills, votes, tweets, press releases, staffers, caucuses, and floor statements, Quorum equips users with the tools they need to navigate the legislative process in a powerful, flexible, and easy-to-use way. Quorum’s quantitative approach to politics is changing the way people see, explain, and influence the legislative process.
###Ready!
Everyday we have to “guess” our travel time for an unfamiliar yet time-sensitive trip. We consult map apps which only shows real-time traffic condition, but how about planning ahead? For example, how do you know exactly how bad the Monday morning traffic will be on a Sunday night? How much “buffer time” should you allow yourself in order to arrive on time and still get enough sleep?

READY! takes care of that problem by offering users a comprehensive and personalized hub for travel time estimation. With integrated traffic analysis and intelligent behavioral learning, READY! assures you a fashionably-on-time arrival without an unnecessary early morning rise.

Simply input the route and preferred time of arrival, READY! automatically sets up an alarm for departure based on historical traffic data, weather forecast, potential congestion-generating events, traffic control regime, user’s lifestyle and driving habits. Even better, READY! monitors real-time traffic condition and user-generated accident reports and silently updates the alert time in the background.

Moreover, with the future introduction of friends system, READY! can assist users in arranging road trips or simply creates a gather-together, using personal punctuality history to encourage on-time arrival for all participants.
###Serve
To accomplish any moderately complex task, mobile users employ a number of applications on their device, which forces the need for internet connectivity and adds to a growing clutter of installed content. Serve provides a platform for developers to create and share programs that can be run via text messaging. Consumers can then curate their own set of commands to run these programs, which are now immediately accessible through the ubiquitous medium of texting. Program execution is thus exported from a user’s device into the cloud. With Serve, both consumers and developers obtain a dependable way to accomplish tasks without the limitations of installed applications.
###SimpleHealth
Heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide and kills more people than cancer and HIV combined. We have a medical device that will be able to predict heart attacks months before they happen. It is unique because it is free to patients and doctors, and has better algorithms than anything in the current market. Another problem is that doctors have too many patients and it's hard to search for which ones need attention before problems occur (preventative medicine). Our device screens patients in parallel and simplifies this search problem.
###SmartLens
Intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements are used for glaucoma diagnosis and patient monitoring. Increased pressure would lead to nerve damages and causes loss of vision as it progress. There is no cure for the damaged nerves and vision loss can’t be recovered. Therefore, it is crucial to stop the diseases' progression by lowering IOP using drugs. There are important challenges treating glaucoma that needs to be addressed. Ophthalmologist prescribe different drugs to treat and lower the IOP. That can vary from one drug to several drugs together. They can’t be sure which drugs are effective since there is no apparent sign for healing. Compliance has been significant issue, since there is no symptoms for increased IOP. Recent studies has shown that IOP can fluctuate throughout the day and is also dependent on body posture. If a patient visits doctor’s office on low pressure period, they may misdiagnose and won’t able to provide needed treatment. Our solution is a contact lens with a pressure sensor for glaucoma that allows IOP to be read by a smartphone camera. The implanted sensor lens coupled with a smartphone allows for at-home monitoring and recording through connection to a medical provider database.

###Solfice CivilMaps
Solfice Research, Inc. is developing the Solfice CivilMaps search engine for 3D survey data. CivilMaps queries terabytes of collected 3D survey data and creates search results in the form of object location and health reports. CivilMaps target customer's biggest pain point is the length of time to create object location and health reports. Currently, processing huge 3D survey datasets is limited by point-and-click object annotation techniques of a human and the limited resources of the user’s computer (I/O, CPU, Network, Memory). By circumventing these bottlenecks, CivilMaps is introducing a paradigm shift in the workflow of creating reports from 3D survey data. Advancements in parallel computing and deep learning allows CivilMaps to reduce 2 years of manual point-and-click work down to 2 days of processing using CivilMap's proprietary machine learning algorithms in the cloud. CivilMaps allows users to upload their 3D survey data, then specify the assets of interest and report specification. Upon upload, the product indexes all of the spatial information as defined in the report specification into a queryable format. The reports can then be dynamically generated on demand and exported to various tools such as AutoDesk Map3D, which is useful for integrating into the customer’s workflow.

###Spectrum
Buildings consume significant amounts of energy and are the single greatest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions in urban areas. Despite this demand on the environment, current architectural practice lacks tools that effectively inform architects of the life cycle environmental impact and cost implications of design decisions. The absence of analytical feedback on design decisions early in the design process require architecture firms to spend $2.8 annually on rework costs. Left without an integrated design assessment solution, the architecture industry will continue to waste money as well as be the single greatest contributor to global carbon emissions. Spectrum is a software platform that provides automated feedback on architectural design decisions by seamlessly integrating with architect’s current design environment. The software plugs in to 3D building information modeling software and integrates cloud processing, computational algorithms, and a building materials database with life cycle assessment, costing, maintenance, and energy simulation software. The algorithms quickly compute the carbon and cost performance of many design alternatives for various design parameters. An interactive dashboard provides sustainability metrics and allows real-time visualization of the current design’s performance relative to the alternatives. Ultimately the software enables architects to efficiently make decisions that meet their sustainability and budget goals.

###TOTO Express
For rural artisans in India the situation is dire. Across 1500 villagers we surveyed in West Bengal, income for a family of 6 is under $1000, education level beyond grade 8 is a fraction of a percent, and average life expectancy is 32. When we asked the villagers what the cause of these issues were, the number one response was lack of income. The assumption is that their artisan skills are no longer valuable and thus hundreds leave the village for the city to seek better. In reality the majority do not find better circumstances as over 65 million currently live in slums, exposed to exploitation and separated from their families. Our solution comes directly from village surveys citing factors that hold back their craft business. From this we have created a bundle of 4 services: connecting to micro-lenders, forming producer groups, providing design education and creating market links. The uniqueness of our solution is in the bundle itself and our goal to make it teachable in months. The first three services we believe are teachable processes, while the market links will be a platform of buyers TOTO Express builds that villages will gain access to upon training completion.
###UnifiApp
Demand for mobile data is surging in India, where it’s expected to grow 126-fold from 2013 to 2018 due to increasing smartphone adoption. 

India is struggling to service this growing mobile data demand. Existing 3G networks are overloaded, and the country faces a significant spectrum capacity crunch. While carriers’ mobile data costs have decreased linearly, per capita data usage is increasing exponentially, leading to higher user costs. Most Indian consumers are extremely price-sensitive, so the high cost of carrier-provided mobile data inhibits many users enjoying Internet access.

UnifiApp is a crowdsourced WiFi platform that unlocks mobile connectivity in emerging markets. Our Android app allows users to share the spare capacity of their WiFi router in exchange for free access to the wider UnifiApp network, which includes the WiFi networks added by all users.

###White Light Medical - AccuSpine
Spinal fusion is a widely-performed and increasingly prevalent surgical technique used to alleviate spinal instabilities and deformities. In the established paradigm, a pedicle probe is used to create the trajectory that a vertebral screw follows. It can be difficult to achieve a stable, or even safe, trajectory, so this technique is most often performed under fluoroscopic (X-ray) guidance resulting in radiation exposure 10-12 times greater than other musculoskeletal procedures. Of the approximately 500,000 spinal fusion surgeries performed annually in the U.S., over 20% of vertebral screws are misplaced, necessitating reoperations in 1 to 5% of all patients. Misplaced screws can cause an array of complications from tearing arteries or intestines to damaging nerve tissue which may result in partial or complete paralysis. Our team has developed a low-cost, smarter pedicle probe, AccuSpine for the accurate placement of vertebral screws. Using an electromechanical method, AccuSpine continuously measures changes in force coupled with a path-identification algorithm to provide real-time navigational guidance for the surgeon, keeping the probe within the bone. Our team aims to reduce screw breach rates, operating room time and radiation exposure, therefore limiting the cost of the procedure while enhancing safety for both patients and doctors.
###XStream
Long haul trucks have a gap between the tractor and the trailer and this is a significant driver of aerodynamic drag. 2/3rd of fuel spent at highway speed is spent overcoming aerodynamic drag and therefore every little bit of savings help. Overall smoothing over this gap saves 3-5% of fuel costs for trucks (confirmed by computational fluid dynamics and wind tunnel tests). The gap exists to allow trucks to turn, but this ability is not required at high speeds. Therefore our device deploys at high speed to cover the gap and retracts when the truck is going slower. This allows us to achieve fuel savings on the highway without compromising on the trucks maneuverability at low speed. Our product has a fully granted patent and a full scale prototype. As one of the most efficient fleets, Walmart recognizes this problem and is excited to test our product. They have offered to pay for extensive, scientific, controlled road tests of our prototype in early April.
